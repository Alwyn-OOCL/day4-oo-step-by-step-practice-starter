Fulfilling
- Java OOP Learning & Practice *strengthened my coding foundation*.
- Refactoring competition is so exciting, our team will get 10 commits if I could speed up my operation in the last round, so *pity* ToT.
- In retrospective meeting we *summarized our performance* and *listed some actions* to guide our behaviour, hope we'll *follow these guidance and do better ðŸ˜€*

The most meaningful moment on today is in the refactoring competition. Teamwork makes us closer undoubtly which makes me satisfied though the result may not satisfying.

# D
- Follow these guidance we listed in retrospective meeting and do better
- May think about how to do better in next team competition
- Learn iterator pattern, prepare the next competition.
